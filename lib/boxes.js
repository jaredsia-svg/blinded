// Turns character spans into rectangles on a rendered page.
//
// A PDF has no lines and no words. It has text-showing operators that place
// runs of glyphs at coordinates, and pdf.js hands those back as items. To go
// from "characters 40 to 58 of this page" to "these three black rectangles",
// three things have to happen: the items get stitched into a plausible reading
// order with the whitespace a human would see, a span gets attributed back to
// the items it covers, and the covered fraction of each item becomes a box.
//
// The last step is the approximate one: within a single item, character
// positions are interpolated by proportion of the string length, because the
// per-glyph advances are not in the text content. For a proportional font the
// edges of a partial-item box can therefore be off by a fraction of a
// character. Two things keep that safe rather than merely close:
//
//   - Boxes are padded outward before they are painted, never inward.
//   - Boxes that touch after padding are merged, so a redaction never has a
//     hairline gap through the middle of a word.
//
// Erring outward means the worst case is covering a neighbouring character.
// Erring inward would mean leaving a sliver of a name visible, which is the
// failure this whole program exists to avoid.
